# Network-Recconniassance-Tool

A simple yet powerful Python tool for scanning and analyzing networks. Whether you're a network admin, security enthusiast, or just curious, this tool helps you explore IP addresses with features like port scanning, DNS lookup, and traceroute.

## What It Does
- **Quick Scan**: Checks common ports fast using Nmap.
- **Port Analysis**: Scans TCP and UDP ports in detail.
- **DNS Lookup**: Finds hostname info for an IP.
- **Traceroute**: Maps the path to the target.
- **Full Scan**: Runs everything at once and gives you a report.
